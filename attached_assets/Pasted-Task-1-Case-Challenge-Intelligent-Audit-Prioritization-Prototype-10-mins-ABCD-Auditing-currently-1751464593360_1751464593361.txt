Task 1: Case Challenge: Intelligent Audit Prioritization Prototype (10 mins)
ABCD Auditing currently selects corporate files in confectionary sector for review using a manual Excel-based
process. Auditors apply heuristic rules to flag companies that may warrant further investigation.
However, the process is manual, varies across reviewers, and lacks transparency. We want to modernize this
approach with a system that can scale, explain its logic, and evolve over time.
Rules:
Dataset provided: Synthetic Data.xlsx
Note: This is synthetic data - all values and company names are fictional and created for demonstration purposes
only. No real-world information is used.
Using the provided dataset (Synthetic Data.xlsx), apply the following business rules:
1. If Bubblegum Tax greater than 50,000, flag the record
2. If the corporation has not been audited in the past 3 years (based on Audit Date), flag it
3. Confectionary Sales Tax % should be dynamically filterable - auditors should be able to adjust the
threshold (e.g., > 5%, > 10%, > 15%), and the flagged results should update accordingly
4. If salary is provided but revenue is blank (or vice versa), flag the inconsistency (Salary, Revenue)
Your Goal:
As part of ABCD audit modernization effort, design a solution that helps auditors:
• Understand and trust the reasoning behind each selection
• Extend the approach in the future (e.g., by learning patterns or enabling “Why this file?” explanations)
10-Minute Presentation - must include:
• How you flagged high-risk files based on the rule logic
• How your solution could go beyond fixed rules to learn patterns or surface outliers - even without labeled
outcomes. All we have is just the rules.
• How auditors can clearly understand why a file was selected (no black-box models)
• How your system could support explainable interaction - including natural-language Q&A (e.g., “Why this
file?”) or auto-generating rationale summaries using GenAI, or a lightweight AI agent to walk through
decisions.
• How your solution could be taken from prototype to production - including how it supports audit review
workflows, automated scoring, explainability, and AI ML/BI system integration
